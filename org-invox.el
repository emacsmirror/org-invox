;;; Commentary:

;; org-invox provides a complete invoicing workflow for software
;; contractors and freelancers using Org mode.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Contract-based invoice management (one contract per client)
;; - Auto-incrementing invoice numbers with configurable format
;; - Configurable tax rates (HST, GST, VAT, etc.) per contract
;; - Configurable payment terms per contract
;; - PDF export via LaTeX with a professional template
;; - Plain Org records for bookkeeping
;; - Master index file per contract with links to all invoices
;;
;; Quick Start:
;;
;;   1. Configure your business details:
;;      (setq org-invox-from-name "Your Name"
;;            org-invox-from-company "Your Company"
;;            org-invox-from-address "Your Address"
;;            org-invox-from-email "you@example.com")
;;
;;   2. Create a new contract:
;;      M-x org-invox-new-contract
;;
;;   3. Create an invoice:
;;      M-x org-invox-create
;;
;;   4. Export to PDF:
;;      M-x org-invox-export-pdf
;;
;;   5. Mark as paid:
;;      M-x org-invox-mark-paid
